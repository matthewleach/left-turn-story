            <p>I almost hit it.
                <br> The wheel.
                <br> The horn.
                <br> With my fist.
                <br> My hand jerked in that spastic motion when you are anxious and wanting everyone to move faster than the slow pace they are accustomed to by hitting the steering wheel, but I don't.
                <br> GO!!!
                <br> Gawd damn it! You had plenty of time to go. I'm tired and hungry and a mile from home and glaring at the red taillights of the car sitting in front of me that is taking forever to take this left turn.</p>

            <p>Finally…I see a larger break in the cars ahead. Ok…this car is finally going to move. And that’s when I see the mini-van. Well…ok. I see the bright lights and the blur of a mini-van as it is moving towards us in between the cars of waiting left-turners across the intersection. It was one of those moments where time slows down so everything is clear and memorable. It wasn't that the car in front of me didn't have time to make the turn, but it seemed to be pulling into the intersection at a crawl. I was anxious again and I wanting the car to move faster. I remember thinking there was a chance that car can make it though the intersection before the minivan hits it. The headlights of the mini-van dissappeared and my mind paused for a moment to wondered where they went. The black car seemed to just hang in the middle intersection of a brief second. A very brief second. I don't even remember being able to hear the radio that was cranked up with tunes. Everything was silent. The two cars collided nearly head-on in a split second of blur.</p>

            <p>Crunch.</p>

            <p>Thish was the only sound as broken glass shot scattering across the pavement as the two cars bounced across the intersection like pool balls. </p>

            <p>And silence again. That uncomfortable silence.</p>

            <p>Thrust. Slam. Park was the gearshift. Tick tick tick of the emergence break lights as I hit the big red button on the dashboard. Click of my door opening as I walked into the coldness.</p>

            <p>Only steps away was the black car and its window open just enough for what appeared to be smoke puffing out. Just enough for my hand to fit through and touch the old man’s chest lightly, hoping to dispel any sense that he was alone as he sat behind a steering wheel breathing in the thick air. Sir…are you ok? Moan…His old tired eyes were focused on nothing and both his hands were clutching his chest. I pushed down the loose airbag that was lying across his face trying to make room for him to breath. Sir…are you hurt? My chest, he moaned…my chest. It wasn't smoke, but the smell of gunpowder that was choking. Sir…that was the airbag. The pain in your chest was from your airbag hitting you. You are going to be ok I tried to reassure him without any true knowledge of his situation.
                <br> Head up.
                <br> Fresh air.
                <br> Cool, but fresh.
                <br> The gun powder taste was still on my tongue.</p>

            <p>Cell phone? Who has one I called out?
                <br> A young blond was moving in front of my car with it raised above her head towards us. I have a cell phone she was saying as she was rushing towards us with her hand outstretched as if she wanted me to make the call. Call 911 and send at least two ambulances I asked. The mini-van was still and two other bystanders were at the driver’s door trying to assist them. Yes…they will need an ambulance also I thought. The door was jammed and I had a little trouble reaching the locks. I walked around the car trying to open the doors. All locked. I was back at the drivers door. Just break the window I heard over my shoulder.</p>

            <p>Stretch. Click. Unlocked. My arm barely fit in the window.
                <br> The door opened a crack. Pull. Rip. Bend. The door opened. It was a very unique feeling actually bending open a door and the feeling of the crumpled metal fold benighted my weight.</p>

            <p>I have my hands on Joe’s hands that is on his chest. Can you tell me your name? Joe…Joe something he tells me in Spanish. I forgot the name before he even finished saying it. Joe, your going to be ok. Does anything other then your chest hurt? How do your legs feel? Ok…how about your neck? Head? Ok Joe. Don’t worry. These are things you ask people that have been hurt, right? If anything, it is a great distraction to the fact that there isn't anything I can do to really help at the moment than to attempt to distract him from his pain and assure him that help is on the way. You are going to be alright. He just moaned responses I didn't even hear.</p>

            <p>The brush of the passing cars made me second guess the location that my ass was sticking out into. I couldn't believe that people were still flying though this intersection around those of us trying to help. Last thing I need is to be crunched between another car and Joe - as nice of a guy as he seemed to be. I moved around the car and between the onlookers into the passenger seat and dropped inside. See Joe…your going to be ok I tried to say as confidently as possible. Moan was all he could get out.</p>

            <p>Petite. Brunette hair. A young mother figure is now asking me for a watch while looking over Joe. No. I don’t have one as I showed her my wrist to prove it. A black digital watch enters the door above her head. She’s taking his pulse.</p>

            <p>Don’t move him! Don’t move his head!
                <br> Bystanders too shocked to do anything are now backseat driving. Almost doing as good of a job as Joe did behind the wheel.</p>

            <p>I saw the badge before I saw his face. I’m a police officer he said with his badge on a chain in front of the Joe's face. A shield that Joe couldn't see through the half-shut whites of his eyes.
                <br> No need for me here, now I thought.</p>

            <p>As I get out of the car, they are helping the female driver from the mini-van onto a grey folding chair on the sidewalk. Where the hell did they get a chair I thought? Are you ok, ma’am? Oh my god. I tried to miss him she cried. I almost hit that pole. She broke into sobs. That damn Chryslers airbags didn’t explode said the skinny guy in the Bronco’s jersey that was riding shotgun with the women. It’s ok honey. Oh my god she sobbed with her hands covering her round face. So you guys are ok, right? I asked. Yea…we’re ok. The pole she missed by inches was the streetlight pole that would have left much more of a mark on their car than Joe's car. But I can’t believe those bags didn’t release the Bronco's fan said under his breath again in a murmur still in disbelief.</p>

            <p>The scene was covered in noise and lights. I couldn’t tell if it was nerves or the chilly air that brought me close to shivering.
                <br> Who’s car is this? Yes, that is my car still in the left turn lane. Upon being asked by an uniformed officer I slide into my warm car where I found my ignition still running.</p>

            <p>Thrust. Slam. Drive was the gearshift. Follow the cop was my instructions and I maneuver though the car parts and broken glass and onlookers and lights.
                <br> Thrust. Slam. Park was the gearshift into the gas station parking lot that was right on the corner. All my movements seem to be fast, direct, and deliberate.</p>

            <p>Back into the cold. No thought of getting my jacket from the passenger seat until I’m too cold and too mesmerized by the scene to want to get it.</p>

            <p>I was the one parked behind Joe, I said after being asked who saw what. A large deaf man was trying to sign to his son something to the cop, but the cop shook them away and drilled me.
                <br> He had a chance to go. No, there wasn’t a green arrow, but the light was green. He pulled out too slow and he probably didn't see that mini-van with all the lights behind it. I only saw it because of my view between the cars after it was too late. There was no way the mini-van could avoid it.</p>

            <p>He took both my numbers: my Michigan driver license that I still had and one to reach me by phone. My story was followed up by a blond young girl with red paint on her toes sticking out of her sandals who had the cell phone. Her arms were holding herself tight in her white blouse as she tried to shake off the cold and it reminded me again I should go get my jacket…but I didn’t.
                <br> It was just like in the movies I heard some dark haired high school boy say. It was all in slow motion and I couldn’t believe I was watching it while it was happening. Chalk this up to another learning experience, my boy, I thought. But better you learn on this side of the broken and twisted metal.</p>

            <p>Click. Click. Click. Click. I pulled the camera from my pocket and became that one guy at accidents that people wonder why the hell you want to remember moments like this. It’s not just for me, I thought as I clicked, it will be for the story I'll share later knowing how every moment of this event was so vivid. The images were blurred, I couldn’t tell if the settings were off or if I was just shaking. Regardless. This blurriness would be how I remember it anyways.</p>

            <p>The last thoughts I had as I was leaving the scene…
                <br> I almost rushed Joe. This could have been my fault.</p>

            <p>The horn.
                <br> The wheel.
                <br> I almost hit it.</p>
