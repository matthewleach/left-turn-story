                <p><font size="2"> I almost hit it. <br>
        The wheel.<br>
        The horn.<br>
        My hand jerked in that spastic motion when you are <br>
        anxious and wanting to move. <br>
        GO!!!<br>
        God damn it! You had plenty of time to go. <br>
        <br>
        I’m just sitting here at a green light waiting for you to wake up. <br>
        Shit.<br>
        <br>
        Finally… I see the break in the cars. Ok.. this guy is finally going to 
        turn left. <br>
        And that’s when I see the mini-van. Well… ok. I see the lights and the 
        blur of a mini-van in between the cars of waiting left turners across 
        the intersection. So this guy didn’t pull out fast enough and in that 
        moment, I wondered where that mini-van disappeared to. The car in front 
        of me was almost though the intersection. The two cars collided head-on 
        in a split second of blur.<br>
        </font><font size="2"><br>
        Crunch.<br>
        <br>
        Thish was the sound of the broken glass as the two cars bounced like pool 
        balls.<br>
        <br>
        And silence.<br>
        <br>
        Thrust. Slam. Park was the gearshift. Tick of the emergence breaks button. 
        Click of my door opening. <br>
        <br>
        His window was opened a crack. Enough for my hand to fit though and touch 
        the old man’s chest lightly. Sir… are you ok? Moan… His tired eyes where 
        focused on nothing and both his hands were clutching his chest. Sir… are 
        you hurt? My chest, he moaned… my chest. Both airbags had exploded and 
        I pushed down the bag that was lying in his lap. The smell of gunpowder 
        was choking. Sir… that was the airbag. The pain in your chest was from 
        your airbag hitting you. You are going to be ok. <br>
        Head up. <br>
        Fresh air. <br>
        <br>
        Cell phone? Who has one? <br>
        Blond moving in front of my car with it raised above her head. I have 
        a cell phone she was saying as she was rushing to the car. <br>
        Call 911 and send two ambulances. <br>
        The mini-van was still and two people were on at the driver’s door. Yes.. 
        they will need an ambulance also I thought.<br>
        The door was jammed and I had a little trouble reaching the locks. I walked 
        around the car trying to open the doors. All locked. Back at the drivers 
        door. Just break the window Erinize says. <br>
        <br>
        Stretch. Click. Unlocked. <br>
        Door opens a crack. Pull. Rip. Bend. The door is open.<br>
        <br>
        I have my hands on Joe’s hands that is on his chest. Can you tell me your 
        name? Joe… Joe something in Spanish I forgot before he finished saying 
        it. Joe, your going to be ok. Does anything other then your chest hurt? 
        How do your legs feel? Ok.. how about your neck? Head? Ok Joe. Don’t worry. 
        You are going to be alright. <br>
        <br>
        The brush of the passing cars made me second guess the location that my 
        ass was sicking out into. Last thing I need is to be crunched between 
        another car and Joe. I moved around the car and between the onlookers 
        to the passenger seat and dropped inside. See Joe… your going to be ok. 
        Moan was all he could get out. <br>
        <br>
        Petite. Brunette hair. A young mother figure is now asking me for a watch 
        looking over Joe. No. I don’t have one as I show my wrist to prove it. 
        <br>
        A black digital watch enters the door above her head. She’s taking his 
        pulse. <br>
        <br>
        Don’t move him! Don’t move his head! <br>
        Bystanders too shocked to do anything are now backseat driving. Almost 
        doing as good of a job as Joe did behind the wheel. <br>
        <br>
        I saw the badge before I saw his face. I’m a police officer he said with 
        his badge on a chain in front of the man’s face that he couldn't see through 
        his half-shut whites of his eyes. <br>
        No need for me here, now.<br>
        <br>
        As I get out of the car, they are helping the women from the mini-van 
        onto a chair on the sidewalk. Where the hell did they get a chair? Are 
        you ok, ma’am? Oh my god. I tried to miss him. I almost hit that pole. 
        She broke into sobs. That damn Chryslers airbags didn’t explode said the 
        skinny guy in the Bronco’s jersey that was riding shotgun. It’s ok honey. 
        Oh my god she sobbed with her hands covering her round face. So you guys 
        are ok, right? Yea.. we’re ok. But I can’t believe those bags didn’t release 
        he said under his breath again in a murmur.<br>
        <br>
        The scene was covered in noise and lights. I couldn’t tell if it was nerves 
        or the chilly air that brought me close to shivering. <br>
        Who’s car is this? Can you move it? I slide into my warm car with the 
        ignition still running. <br>
        <br>
        Thrust. Slam. Drive was the gearshift. Follow the cop was my instructions 
        and I maneuver though the car parts and broken glass and onlookers and 
        lights. <br>
        Thrust. Slam. Park was the gearshift into the gas station parking lot. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Back into the cold. No thought of getting my jacket from the passenger 
        seat until I’m too cold and too mesmerized by the scene to want to get 
        it. <br>
        <br>
        I was the one parked behind Joe, I said after being asked who saw what. 
        A large deaf man was trying to sign to his son something to the cop, but 
        the cop shook it away and drilled me. <br>
        He had a chance to go. No, there wasn’t a green arrow, but the light was 
        green. He pulled out too slow and he couldn’t see that mini-van. I only 
        saw it because of my view between the cars after it was too late. There 
        was no way the mini-van could avoid it. <br>
        <br>
        He took both my numbers: Michigan driver license and one to reach me. 
        <br>
        My story was followed up by a blond young girl with red paint on her toes 
        sticking out of her sandals who had the cell phone. Her arms were holding 
        herself tight in her white blouse as tried to shake off the cold and reminded 
        me again I should go get my jacket and didn’t. <br>
        It was just like in the movies says the high school boy, Erinize. It was 
        all in slow motion and I couldn’t believe I was watching it while it was 
        happening. Chalk this up to another learning experience, my boy, I thought. 
        But better you learn on this side of the broken and twisted metal. <br>
        <br>
        Click. Click. Click. Click. I pulled the camera from my pocket and became 
        that one guy at accidents that people wonder why the hell you want to 
        remember this moment. It’s not just for me, I thought as I clicked. Although 
        the images were blurred I couldn’t tell if the settings were off or if 
        I was just shaking. Regardless. This blurriness would be how I remember 
        it.<br>
        <br>
        The last thoughts I had as I was leaving the scene… <br>
        I almost rushed him. That could have been my fault. </font>
